    <h4>ACT II.
        Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster.Westminster Hall, L.  Clock
        tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight. <br>

    <h4 class="name mount">LORD MOUNTARARAT.</h4>
    <p class="song mount">When Britain really ruled the waves—
        (In good Queen Bess's time)
   The House of Peers made no pretence
   To intellectual eminence,
        Or scholarship sublime;
   Yet Britain won her proudest bays
   In good Queen Bess's glorious days!
</p>
    <h4 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h4>
    <p class="song">Yes, Britain won, etc.

        When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
             As every child can tell,
        The House of Peers, throughout the war,
        Did nothing in particular,
             And did it very well:
        Yet Britain set the world ablaze
        In good King George's glorious days!</p>

        <h4 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h4>
        <p class="song">Yes, Britain set, etc.

            And while the House of Peers withholds
                 Its legislative hand,
            And noble statesmen do not itch
            To interfere with matters which
                 They do not understand,
            As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
            As in King George's glorious days!</p>

        
            <h4 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h4>
            <p class="song">As bright will shine, etc.</p>

        
    <h4 class="name leila">LEL.</h4>
    <p class="song leila"> (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
        song).  Charming persons, are they not?
