        <h6>Act II</h6>
        <p>Kind Captain, I've important information,<br>
           Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,<br>
           About a certain intimate relation,<br>
           Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.<br>
           The merry maiden and the tar.<br>
           Good fellow, in conundrums you are speaking,<br>
           Sing hey, the mystic sailor that you are;<br>
           The answer to them vainly I am seeking;<br>
           Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.<br></p>

            <p>The merry maiden and the tar.<br>
            Did you hear him? Did you hear him?<br>
            Oh, the monster overbearing!M<br>
            Don't go near him—don't go near him—<br>
            He is swearing—he is swearing!<br>
           My pain and my distress,<br>
           I find it is not easy to express;<br>
           My amazement—my surprise—<br>
           You may learn from the expression of my eyes!<br></p>

           <p>My lord—one word—the facts are not before<br>
           The word was injudicious, I allow—<br>
           But hear my explanation, I implore you,<br>
           And you will be indignant too, I vow!<br>
           I will hear of no defence,<br>
           Attempt none if you're sensible.<br>
           That word of evil sense<br>
           Is wholly indefensible.<br>
           Go, ribald, get you hence<br>
           To your cabin with celerity.<br>
           This is the consequence<br>
           Of ill-advised asperity<br>
            </p>
