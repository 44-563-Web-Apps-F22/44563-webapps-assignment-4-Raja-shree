            Running a-muck of all abuses.
       His unqualified assent
            Somehow nobody now refuses.
                 Whigs and Tories
                 Dim their glories,
       Giving an ear to all his stories
       Carrying every Bill he may wish:
       Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
            Kettle of fish!
            Kettle of fish!
       Here's a pretty kettle of fish!</p>

        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!

            Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
